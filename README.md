# Hello Eleventy

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a simple static site generator. That means you get all the power of a server-side framework but it builds plain HTML files. 

While you're working in the editor your changes will happen ü™Ñ immediately in the preview window. As you code the site is serving files from a local build directory. When you close the editor your site will run a `build` script then serve the output as a fast and always-on static site.

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/index.css`: The styling rules for your pages and posts.

‚Üê `src/`: This folder contains all the files Eleventy will use to build your site.

### Working in the `src/` folder üìÅ

‚Üê `src/index.md`, `src/posts.md`, `src/about.md`: These Markdown files are the content for your Home, Posts, and About pages.

‚Üê `src/posts/`: These are the Markdown files for the posts that make up your blog.

‚Üê `src/seo.json`: When you're ready to share your new site or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

‚Üê `src/_includes`: This is where all of your page level layouts go. The **\_** tells you that this is an _eleventy only_ folder.
