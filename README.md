Welcome to InstaLink!
=================

InstaLink is a simple Instagram Bio Link Generator. 


CORE & CONTANER
====
[insta.benja.ml]("https://insta.benja.ml") Is running InstaLink Contaner (v1.6). I plan to update it to Core 2.0.3 As soon as possible.  

`CORE`: Good for multiple pages. 
`CONTANER`: Good for 1 page


V1 Supports gradient backrounds  V2 Will Not support gradient backrounds.


CONTANER THEMES
===============
Contanier will have a option for custom themes. I will provide a repo with all of the themes. 


Geting Started
==============

You can host InstaLink CORE & CONTANER on static hosts (Netfly, Gh-pages, etc...). Fork the repo and you are good to go!
